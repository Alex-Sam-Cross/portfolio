            I am a highly focused, self-motivated and innovative developer with many years’ experience in a variety of development and engineering positions. A versatile and competent Front-end Developer with a sound knowledge and understanding of developing, maintaining and enhancing complex user interfaces. I boast knowledge of a wide range of programming languages while specialising in React. Prior experience within a System Engineer role has enabled me to gain a greater understanding and additional depth to approaching development with scalability, adaptability and reliability. I am extremely driven and determined to exceed expectations. This drive to learn more and do more is evident in successive performance and development reviews for achieving “above and beyond”. I am a methodical thinker with good problem-solving skills and high standards, achieving reliable, neat and concise coding, adhering to convention and standards. I have excellent communication and interpersonal skills that allow me to build lasting working relationships with clients, senior management and colleagues. I have also represented colleagues in my previous roles within Social Committees, to aid in the facilitation and maintenance of high office morale and team bonding.
